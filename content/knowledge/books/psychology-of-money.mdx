Psychology of Money is a fascinating exploration of the ways our emotions and beliefs influence our financial decisions. Author Morgan Housel combines storytelling with research to illustrate how our relationship with money is often shaped by psychological factors rather than purely rational decision-making. From the impact of upbringing to the influence of social norms, this book provides valuable insights into understanding and managing personal finances.
